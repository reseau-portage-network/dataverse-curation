|       Service Type		   |       Service Description |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       Unmediated curation    |       There is no intervention from the RDM service. The researcher creates their own dataverse and dataset, submits their data and publishes it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|       Semi-mediated curation |       The RDM service creates a dataverse or starts a dataset deposit and assigns a role to the researcher. The researcher submits data to their dataverse (or dataset). Depending on local policy, the dataset is either flagged for review by the institutional dataverse administrators, or the depositor requests to have the dataset reviewed by the data management team before or after it is published.     |
|       Mediated curation      |       Data is submitted by the researcher to the RDM service. The RDM service creates the dataverse (or dataset) and the data is curated by the library and published once approved by the researcher.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
