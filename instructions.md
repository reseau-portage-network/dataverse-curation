This guide provides step-by-step instructions for curating new datasets deposited in Dataverse. Data curation deals with the active management of research data as it is created, maintained, used, archived, shared, and reused . The guide is framed around the acronym CURATION to provide an easy reminder for curators, especially those starting out, of the main steps in the curation process. This framework is adapted from the Data Curation Network’s CURATED steps  for use in a bilingual context and is intended to outline and provide guidance on curation best practices in Dataverse. Data curation is not always a linear process; the type of data you are working with, your institutional policies or practices, your comfort level with curation, and the amount of time the researcher is able to dedicate to the process may require you to skip steps or complete the steps in a different order. You may also need to circle back and complete some of the steps a second time. The level of curation your institution is able to offer, given competing priorities and number of staff dedicated to the curation service, may also determine how many curation steps you can complete. 

Our Guide acknowledges there is no “one size fits all” model to data curation. The level and quality of curation is dependent on local resourcing, capacity, policies, priorities, and institutional strategic direction. As a result, the Guide has been developed with flexibility in mind . It can be used by new or experienced curators within academic institutions of all sizes, and it can be adapted by institutions to meet the needs of local policies and procedures.

## Possible Curation Service Scenarios

|Service Type|Service Description|
|:--|:--|
|Unmediated curation|There is no intervention from the RDM service. The researcher creates their own dataverse and dataset, submits their data and publishes it.|
|Semi-mediated curation|The RDM service creates a dataverse or starts a dataset deposit and assigns a role to the researcher. The researcher submits data to their dataverse (or dataset). Depending on local policy, the dataset is either flagged for review by the institutional dataverse administrators, or the depositor requests to have the dataset reviewed by the data management team before or after it is published.|
|Mediated curation|Data is submitted by the researcher to the RDM service. The RDM service creates the dataverse (or dataset) and the data is curated by the library and published once approved by the researcher.|


## Levels of Curation

The CURATION checklist is divided into 3 levels: Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. Level 1 is the basic required information that should be completed to publish a dataset in Dataverse. Depending on the level of service that your institution is able to provide, you may be able to complete some of the items in levels 2 and 3. A description of each level is below:

|       Curation Level		   |       Description |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|Level 1 | The minimum steps required to successfully publish in Dataverse and make the dataset findable, i.e., the dataset has been submitted to the proper dataverse and required metadata fields are accurate.|
|Level 2 | Activities that enhance the discoverability of datasets and help ensure their usability over time. E.g., recommended metadata fields are populated and dataset includes sufficient documentation to allow a user with a similar background to understand the dataset and open and use the files.|
|Level 3 | Intensive curation actions intended to prepare datasets for preservation and improve the chances that data and code can be used to reproduce or replicate an associated study. For example, supporting documentation is enhanced, the content of files and code are reviewed, and data files are transformed into formats suitable for long-term preservation.|
