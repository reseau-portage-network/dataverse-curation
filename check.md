Depending on the configuration of your Dataverse instance, researchers may have the option to submit a dataset to a number of parent dataverses (or create a new one). To evaluate whether the dataset is in the most appropriate dataverse, consider the following: <br>   • Has the researcher (or their research group) previously created or submitted to a dataverse? <br>  • Does the dataset require its own dataverse or is there an associated dataverse to which it belongs? <br>  • Does the dataset conform to the policies and submission standards associated with the specific dataverse?|
